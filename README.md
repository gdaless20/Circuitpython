## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
I used Mu to write python code to make an led flash rainbow in a cycle as shown.

# On a Raspberry pi, use this instead, not all pins are supported

)


def wheel(pos):
    # Input a value 0 to 255 to get a color value.
    # The colours are a transition r - g - b - back to r.

### Wiring
There was no wiring for this assignment .

### Reflection
I struggled a lot with making the nano pixel flash different colors . When i tried to write my own code from scratch it would flash red , yellow , and green then flash blue a few times. What ended up working for me was researching online for already written portions of code for this project . I was able to find something that worked and then was able to get my led to flash.



## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

With using Mu and python code to make a servo slowly turn .

```python
"""CircuitPython Essentials Servo continuous rotation servo example"""
import time
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.ContinuousServo(pwm)

while True:
    print("forward")
    my_servo.throttle = 1.0
    time.sleep(2.0)
    print("stop")
    my_servo.throttle = 0.0
    time.sleep(2.0)
    print("reverse")
    my_servo.throttle = -1.0
    time.sleep(2.0)
    print("stop")
    my_servo.throttle = 0.0
    time.sleep(4.0)

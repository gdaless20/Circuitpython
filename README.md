## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
I used Mu to write python code to make an led flash rainbow in a cycle as shown.

### Wiring
There was no wiring for this assignment .

### Reflection
I struggled a lot with making the nano pixel flash different colors . When i tried to write my own code from scratch it would flash red , yellow , and green then flash blue a few times. What ended up working for me was researching online for already written portions of code for this project . I was able to find something that worked and then was able to get my led to flash.



## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

With using Mu and python code to make a servo slowly turn .

```python
"""CircuitPython Essentials Servo continuous rotation servo example"""
import time
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.ContinuousServo(pwm)

while True:
    print("forward")
    my_servo.throttle = 1.0
    time.sleep(2.0)
    print("stop")
    my_servo.throttle = 0.0
    time.sleep(2.0)
    print("reverse")
    my_servo.throttle = -1.0
    time.sleep(2.0)
    print("stop")
    my_servo.throttle = 0.0
    time.sleep(4.0)


```

### Reflection
 I once again had a problem with my code when i tried doing it from scratch . Im not very good at coding so ive learned that researching what code im going to write before i do it helps me a lot in the long run and tends to save me time.



## CircuitPython Distance Servo

### Description & Code

```python

r = 0
g = 0
b = 0


while True:

    try:
        distance = sonar.distance
        print((distance,))

        if distance < 5:
            r = 255
            g = 0
            b = 0
        elif distance > 5 and distance < 20:

            g = int(g)
            b = int(b)

            r = 0
            b = 0
            g = 255
            r = int(r)
            g = int(g)
            b = int(b)
        print(r, g, b)

        time.sleep(0.1)

    print(r, g, b)
    dot.fill((r, g, b))
    time.sleep(0.05)
